# convLSTM_Prediction_AnomalyDetection
We combine reconstruction/prediction over many frames with interleaved LSTMs to train an end-to-end deep model 
for learning normal appearances and motions in video sequences. Then deriving an anomaly score from 
reconstruction/prediction error for anomaly detection
